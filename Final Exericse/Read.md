## 1.Background

In this summer holiday, I participated in the CUPT( China Undergraduate Physics Tournament) and analysed one problem related to the randomness

### Invent yourself   

Truly random numbers are a very valuable and rare resource. Design, produce, and test a mechanical device for producing random numbers.  Analyse  to what extent the randomness 
produced is safe against ering tamp
Based on the previous research, I had the fundamental knowledge of random number, even if this problem urged that we should produce the truly
random number, which was irrelated to the problem I told in this paper.
