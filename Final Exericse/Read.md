## 2.Abstract

In this essay, we consider this kind of system, where random occupy the important position, this system is known as stochastic system.These systems are generally contain a large number of "freedom", such as a large number of water molecules in a drop of rain, or spins in a ferromagnet.
In this system, although in theory, each particle movement can be determined by the laws of mechanics, but it will be a differential equation of astronomical,lead to the impossibility of practical solution.For this case, we use the theory of probability to describe the system, making the original system simliar to the stochastic system on some macroscopic properties we are interested in.Through exploring the random system, we can understand the real system.
When dealing with stochastic system, if we want to use experiments to explore its regularity, according to Kolmogorov Law of Large Numbers, the number of experiments should be very big,. The reality of the experiment will inevitably time-consuming, difficult to achieve.Out of this consideration, we can use the numerical calculation method, random Numbers generated by random number generator using a computer the rapid computing capacity, hundreds of thousands of times experiment task.
In a lot of random process, what we are interested in is the issues of random walk. Random walk problem of one dimensional case, refers to a particle initial point is located in the origin, after every time after the same time interval, walking to the right or to left, the probability of two direction could be the same, also may be different as well as that step length may be within the scope of a random.The two-dimensional arbitrary direction, each step of the cases, the other properties are similar and one dimensional.

### Problem 7.1
Calculate the diffusion constant analytically for the random-walk simulations in Figure 7.3 and 7.4. These simulations were carried out in one dimension and on a three-dimension simple-cubic lattice (respectively). Can you generalize your analytic results to a wider class of lattice types such a two-dimension triangular lattice, or a three-dimensional face-centered or body-centered cubic lattice.

### Problem 7.2
Simulate a random walk in three dimensions allowing the walker to make steps of unit length in random directions; don't restrict the walker to sites on a discrete lattice. Show that the motion is diffusive, that is <r^>~t. Find the value of the proportionality constant.

### Problem 7.3
Investigate the behavior of a random walk in which the probabilities for different step directions are not equal. For example, consider a one-dimension walk with 0.25 probability of the left and 0.75 to right. In what sense is the motion still diffusive

### Problem 7.4
The calculation value for <x^2> in Figure 7.2 do not agree perfectly with the theoretical prediction (7.1) with D=1/2. Instead, these values exhibit statistical fluctuation about the theoretical curve. Show that these fluctuations follow a Gaussian form. Apply the chi-square test to demonstrate that these their magnitude is consistent with the expected statistical fluctuations.

## 3.Body content

### 1.Random walking in one-dimension

Here we consider a typical problem of one-dimensional random walk. Particles' initial point are located at x = 0, step length is 1, fixed time interval between adjacent two steps (steps it is proportional to the time), the probabilities of each step to the left and right are 0.5.We assume that there are 5000 of the same particles, the average properties of observe their movement.
Their changeable relationship between the distance from the origin and steps are

As we can see from this graph, the average distance from the origin of particles in this system remains near zero.According to the theory of probability, the probability of particles to the left to the right are the same which suggest that the average distance from the origin should to 0.The numerical results and theoretical results are consistent.
Their changeable relationship between the sqaure of the distance from the origin and steps are
[![](https://github.com/gmd3250679/compuational_physics_N2014301020111/blob/master/Final%20Exericse/Figure/FE2.png)](https://github.com/gmd3250679/compuational_physics_N2014301020111/blob/master/Final%20Exericse/Code/r2.py)
The mean square of the x shows approximate linear relationship with steps. This linear relationship has also appeared in the one-dimensional diffusion system, suggesting that the random walk process is the problem of "analogous diffusion".
Next we will generalize the condition, every step length are a value between 1 ~ + 1, and take the probability of each value is constant.
The changeable relationship between the two steps are

[![](https://github.com/gmd3250679/compuational_physics_N2014301020111/blob/master/Final%20Exericse/Figure/FE4.png)](https://github.com/gmd3250679/compuational_physics_N2014301020111/blob/master/Final%20Exericse/Code/r4.py)
As shown on the graph, the mean value of x fluctuates near zero and the mean square of x has the approximate linear relationshp with steps, too.

### 2.Distinctive probabilities in random walk problem

Here we review the situation where turn left and right movement probabilities are not same.Probability is 0.75 with we walking to the right and that to the left is 0.25, the fixed step size is 1, observe two average change with steps for relationships
[![](https://github.com/gmd3250679/compuational_physics_N2014301020111/blob/master/Final%20Exericse/Figure/FE5.png)](https://github.com/gmd3250679/compuational_physics_N2014301020111/blob/master/Final%20Exericse/Code/r5.py)
[![](https://github.com/gmd3250679/compuational_physics_N2014301020111/blob/master/Final%20Exericse/Figure/FE6.png)](https://github.com/gmd3250679/compuational_physics_N2014301020111/blob/master/Final%20Exericse/Code/r6.py)
The figure shows that the average value of x increases with number linearly and its average square and steps demonstrate a quadratic relationship, which conform to the conclusion of the theory of possibility.

### 3.Random walking and diffusion

Here we discuss the similarity between the random walk and diffusion.Select a large number of random walkers, simulate its changeable relationship between density with time in space. 
In one dimensional case, we obtain
[![](https://github.com/gmd3250679/compuational_physics_N2014301020111/blob/master/Final%20Exericse/Figure/FE7.png)](https://github.com/gmd3250679/compuational_physics_N2014301020111/blob/master/Final%20Exericse/Code/r7.py)
The figure shows that the peak value of density curve drops with the increase of time. At the same time, the total area stays while the width increases.
In the two-dimensional case, we obtain
[![](https://github.com/gmd3250679/compuational_physics_N2014301020111/blob/master/Final%20Exericse/Figure/FE8.png)](https://github.com/gmd3250679/compuational_physics_N2014301020111/blob/master/Final%20Exericse/Code/r8.py)
[![](https://github.com/gmd3250679/compuational_physics_N2014301020111/blob/master/Final%20Exericse/Figure/FE9.png)](https://github.com/gmd3250679/compuational_physics_N2014301020111/blob/master/Final%20Exericse/Code/r9.py)
[![](https://github.com/gmd3250679/compuational_physics_N2014301020111/blob/master/Final%20Exericse/Figure/FE10.png)](https://github.com/gmd3250679/compuational_physics_N2014301020111/blob/master/Final%20Exericse/Code/r10.py)
Pay attention to three different picture of z axis range here. Obviously, two-dimensional situation has the same conclusion as one dimension. And this kind of behavior in accordance with our intuitive sense of a diffusion process, that is we drop a certain of diffusion substance at one single point in inital time, then it spread towards all directions with the centre of this point until the densities are the same everywhere.

### 4. The change of entropy in two dimension

Here we consider a two-dimensional system and research that how the entropy changes. We only take into the the consideration of single particle. When the two dimensional system has the length of 30 lattices, we have the relationship between the entropy and time 
![](https://github.com/gmd3250679/compuational_physics_N2014301020111/blob/master/Final%20Exericse/Figure/F11.png)
As we can see, with time increasing, the entropy value rises but its growth speed is reduced.Eventually it will converge to a constant value.

## 4.Conclusion

Through the numerical calculation based on the Python language, we may draw conclusions of the process of random walk
### 1. For one-dimensional and equal-probability random walk, when there are fixed length for steps, the average value of the distance from the origin is almost zero and the mean value of distance square linearly increases. when step lengthes for the left and the right are equal (1 ~ + 1 randomly), the conclusion remains the same, only the growth speed of the distance square decreases.

### 2. For different propabilities condition, when the step length is fixed, mean value of distance linearly raises, average value of distance square increases with quadratic form.

### 3. For the one-dimensional and two-dimensional random walk processes, when the number of particles are immense, its densities at various points demonstrate diffusion behavior, which is similar-diffusion process.

### 4. For the two-dimensional random walk system, as the time increased, system's entropy increases, growth rate reduces and eventually converges to a constant value.
These results and the theory of probability consistent with our intuition. It proves that, based on the results of numerical calculation of the Python language has great effect on random simulation, the results are credible.
