## 1.Abstract

Three-body system is famous for its complexity and an analytical solution is known not to exist. This is where numerical solutions can show
its values in scientific significance. It is known that te motion of asteriods located near the Kirkwood gaps is believed to be chaotic.And
there is various chaotic motion of planet which will be a fairly difficult stimulation.However,there is one case of chaos in our solar system 
that is accessible to a fairly simple stimulation,that is the Hyperion.In this passage,we are going to investigate the properities of the 
movement of Hyperion.And the behavior of two slightly different intial conditions.

### Problem 4.19

Study the behavior of our model for Hyperion for differnt initial conditions. Estimate the Lyapunov expoenent from calculations fo
